You are going to create a simplified version of the game Battleship. You will create a grid system and generate single-point ships (one hit and it's sunk) at random coordinates. Then in the terminal the user will attempt to attack the computer by entering a coordinate. If it is a hit, the console will print, “Hit”, if it is a miss, the console will print “Miss”.
